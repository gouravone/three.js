# Three.js - Javascript 3D Library

This is a sample work to demonstrate Three.js.

# Getting Started

1. Open terminal and run `npm install --global http-server`
2. Go to root folder and run `http-server . -p 8000`

# Key Highlights

1. 3D models in GLTF is prefered, because it is light-weight & have high performance rendering
2. WebGL is a JavaScript API for rendering high-performance interactive 3D and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins. WebGL does so by introducing an API that closely conforms to OpenGL ES 2.0 that can be used in HTML5 <canvas> elements. Some browser still not support WebGL
